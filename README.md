# wobbly-hops

## What is it?
Wobbly-Hops is a Web-App designed as our 2nd App Development Project at RED Academy. The criteria was to create an app of our choosing using Meteor. The idea is a spin-off, alcoholic, multiplayer version of the popular Doodle Jump.

## What did you learn?
This project was a great learning experience because of the fact that it's a game and not a normal website. It allowed us to program in a different fashion, with a lot of OOP (Object Oriented Programming). There was also routes being used, so it was great practice in linking pages, and only allowing certain pages to be shown on certain conditions.

## What technologies were used?
### Front End:
- React

### Back End:
- Meteor
- MongoDB
- SimpleSchema
